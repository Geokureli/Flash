Pull requests are welcome if you spot a bug or know a more efficient
way to implement something.

### General notes
Don't use crazy characters in your metric, level, leaderboard table etc 
names.  A very good idea is to use the same naming conventions for variables:

- alphanumeric
- keep them short (50 chars is the max)

Play time, country and source information is handled automatically, you do not 
need to do anything to collect that data.

Begin by logging a view which initializes the API, and then log any metrics you 
want.  Play time, repeat visitors etc are handled automatically.

#### Logging views and plays
Call this at the very start of your game loading:

	Playtomic.Log.View(swfid, guid, apikey, root.loaderInfo)
	
		swfid = from your API page in Playtomic
		guid = from your API page in Playtomic
		apikey = from your API page in Playtomic
		loaderinfo = your root.loaderInfo

This registers that the player has viewed your game and initializes the
API.  You can track when the player actually starts playing (eg play button)
by calling this 0 or more times in your game:

	Playtomic.Log.Play();
	
Log.Play can be called multiple times in a single session.

#### Custom metrics
Custom metrics can track any general events you want to follow, like 
tracking who views your credits screen or anything else.

Call this to log any custom data you want to track.

	Playtomic.Log.CustomMetric(name, group, unique)
	
		name = your metric name, eg "ViewedCredits"
		group = optional, specify the group name for sorting in reports
		unique = optional, only count unique occurrences 

#### Level metrics
Level metrics can identify problems players are having with your difficulty 
or anything else by logging information like how many people begin vs. finish
each level.  They can help you identify major problems in your player retention.

These methods log the 3 types of level metrics - counters, ranged-value 
and average-value metrics.

- Counter metrics count how many times an event occurs across levels
- Ranged-value metrics track multiple values across a single event across levels
- Average-value metrics track the average of something across levels

	Playtomic.Log.LevelCounterMetric(name, level, unique)

		name = your metric name
		level = either a level number (int > 0) or a level name
		unique = optional, only count unique-per-view occurrences

	Playtomic.Log.LevelRangedMetric(name, level, value, unique)

		name = your metric name
		level = either a level number (int > 0) or a level name
		value = the value you want to track
		unique = optional, only count unique-per-view occurrences 


	Playtomic.Log.LevelAverageMetric(name, level, value, unique)
		name = your metric name
		level = either a level number (int > 0) or a level name
		value = the value you want to track
		unique = optional, only count unique-per-view occurrences 

#### Link tracking
Link tracking can give you information on how many people click the links 
in your games, including (Flash only) identifying sites that block links.

	Playtomic.Link.Open(url, name, group)

		url = "https://playtomic.com/"
		name = link name
		group = specify the group name for this link (eg "sponsorlinks")

When you track links it automatically tracks the source and country for deep 
analysis in the dashboard, and it automatically tracks domain totals so if 
you have multiple links to the same site you can see each links effectiveness 
as well as the total uniques, clicks and fails for that domain.

The link tracking API does not alter the URL at all, players still go directly 
to the destination!

#### Leaderboards, level sharing, data and geoip 
This stuff gets a little more complicated.  Please check the documentation
