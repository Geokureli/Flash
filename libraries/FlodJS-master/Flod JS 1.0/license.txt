  This is a JavaScript port of my AS3 Flod library, it currently works only in Chrome (I've used version
  17.0.942.0 to develop it), hopefully in the future other browsers will add support for the Web Audio API.

  It took a lot of effort to reach this stage so if you want to use it in any commercial production I'll ask
  you to mention the proper credits and to make a donation to: chreil@hotmail.com via PayPal, thank you.

  You can include just the player(s) you need in your page just remember that all the Amiga players needs
  the Core.js and the Amiga.js files too and the PC player (FT2) needs the Core.js and the Soundblaster.js files.

  Example, including the ProTracker player:
    Core.js
    Amiga.js
    PTPlayer.js

  including the FastTracker II player:
    Core.js
    Soundblaster.js
    F2Player.js
